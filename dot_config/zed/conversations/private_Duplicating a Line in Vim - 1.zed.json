Here are a couple of methods to achieve this:\n\n### Method 1: Using Normal Mode Commands\n1. Make sure you are in Normal mode. If you are not, press `Esc` to switch to Normal mode.\n2. Position the cursor on the line you want to duplicate.\n3. Type `yy` to yank (copy) the line.\n4. Type `p` to paste the copied line below the current line.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n```\nyy\np\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using Visual Mode\n1. Make sure you are in Normal mode. If you are not, press `Esc` to switch to Normal mode.\n2. Position the cursor on the line you want to duplicate.\n3. Press `V` to enter Visual Line mode.\n4. Press `y` to yank (copy) the line.\n5. Press `p` to paste the copied line below the current line.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n```\nV\ny\np\n```\n\n### Method 3: Using Ex Commands\n1. Make sure you are in Normal mode. If you are not, press `Esc` to switch to Normal mode.\n2. Position the cursor on the line you want to duplicate.\n3. Type `:t.` and press `Enter`. This command duplicates the current line and places the copy below it.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n```\n:t.\n```\n\nAny of these methods will allow you to duplicate a line in Vim efficiently.\nThanks!\nYou're welcome!
